Why do people post dark pictures? I don't mean pictures with dark themes, I mean actual dark pictures, because every now and then one pops up in my feed and through that very sliver of a black patch I can see my face. Dark, oily, beard patches that don’t even know what the hell symmetry means. But these are not the things that actually bother me, what bothers me is that shininess in my eyes. I’ve seen that on people, people I had looked down on, people who begged me for 500 rs to buy crystals of dreams, people who were fit to chains and Rorschach tests. I can also feel people noticing it in me too, some are attracted to it, some are dismayed by it. Anyway, I don’t know if it’s a blessing or a curse. Also, in order for it to be a blessing or a curse, it has to be given by someone, but it sure doesn’t feel like that; it feels more like something I was born with, part of my being. It’s just that it grows as I grow, that’s all.
