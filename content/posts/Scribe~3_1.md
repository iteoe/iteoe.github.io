Good-looking people doing good-looking things in a just world, and I stayed here longing for all three of them from my crooked eyes. Their dance moved me so much I have to look up so that my tears won’t run down and hit their pale blue dot. Every now and then, I see through my cloudy eyes a figure with the same crookedness and cloudiness and curves staring at me, and for a brief moment I think that at least I’m not alone. So I wipe the foam from my eyes, try to get a glimpse of that thing, and it will be the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen, and I’ll say to myself, “ohh! You’re one of them too.”
